# Developing on Infineon's XMC4500 Relax Lite Kit
Bare CMake project to develop on Infineon's XMC4500 Relax Kit Lite. Repo's main objective was to understand the toolchain process involved to begin developing on it.

## Dependencies
Will be using [jlink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/flash-download/) to communicate with the device.

```
make cmake arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-gdb jlink debtap gcc lm4flash
```

## Install
Dependencies are based on a Arch Linux system, should work on any Linux distro as long as
the dependencies are installed accordingly.
``` 
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib
paru -S jlink debtap lm4flash
mkdir ~/xmc4500
git clone git@github.com:duclos-cavalcanti/XMC4500_Cmake.git
``` 
## Udev Rules
For access to serial interface add your user to the group `uucp`. 
```
 gpasswd -a username uucp
```
Information on how to communicate with the device can be found in the serial interface article on the arch wiki.

## Downloading XMClib Software
Either
1. Install the XMClib .deb package and convert it.
```
debtap xmclib-<version>.deb
sudo pacman -U xmclib-<version>.pkg.tar.zst
sudo mv /opt/XMClib/ ~/xmc4500/
```
2. Go [here](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/xmclib) and clone the repo which should make the
   necessary library available.
```
git clone https://github.com/PromyLOPh/xmclib
sudo pacman -U xmclib-<version>.pkg.tar.zst
sudo mv /opt/XMClib/ ~/xmc4500/
```
Versions may vary.

## Usage
```
cd ~/xmc4500/XMC4500-Cmake
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make # Compiles
make flash # flashes
make debug # debugs using gdb
```
